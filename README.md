# NoteFlow-Go

A fast, lightweight, cross-platform note-taking application with markdown support, designed to run from any folder and create a web-based interface for managing notes in a single markdown file.

## 🚀 Features

- **Markdown Note-Taking**: Live preview with MathJax support for mathematical notation
- **Task Management**: Persistent checkbox/task system with cross-folder synchronization
- **Global Task View**: Manage tasks across all NoteFlow projects from a central interface
- **Website Archiving**: Comprehensive resource inlining with `+http` prefix
- **Drag & Drop**: File and image uploads with automatic asset management
- **Multiple Themes**: Beautiful color schemes with persistence
- **Single File Storage**: All notes stored in `notes.md` in your working directory
- **Zero Dependencies**: Single binary deployment, no external dependencies
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Fast Performance**: <100ms startup time, <15MB memory usage

## 🆚 Improvements Over Python Version

- **10x Faster Startup**: Go binary vs Python interpreter
- **Lower Memory Usage**: ~15MB vs ~50MB+ for Python version  
- **Cross-Folder Tasks**: SQLite-based task synchronization across projects
- **Single Binary**: No Python runtime or pip dependencies required
- **Better Concurrency**: Native Go routines for background sync
- **Embedded Assets**: All web assets bundled into binary

## 📦 Installation

### Homebrew
```bash
brew install xafloc/noteflow-go/noteflow
```

**Note**: Installs as `noteflow-go` to avoid conflicts with the Python version.

### Easy Installer (Recommended for Windows)
**One-click installation with automatic PATH setup:**

1. Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Xafloc/NoteFlow-Go/releases):
   - Windows: `noteflow-installer_windows_amd64.exe`
   - macOS (Apple Silicon): `noteflow-installer_darwin_arm64`
   - macOS (Intel): `noteflow-installer_darwin_amd64`
   - Linux (ARM): `noteflow-installer_linux_arm64`
   - Linux (x86_64): `noteflow-installer_linux_amd64`

   **Pick the right architecture:** most Macs since 2020 and many newer Linux ARM machines need `arm64`; older Intel Macs and most x86 servers need `amd64`. On macOS/Linux run `uname -m` (`arm64` / `aarch64` → `arm64`, `x86_64` → `amd64`).

2. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   # Windows (double-click or run in PowerShell)
   .\noteflow-installer_windows_amd64.exe

   # macOS (Apple Silicon)
   chmod +x noteflow-installer_darwin_arm64
   ./noteflow-installer_darwin_arm64

   # Linux (x86_64)
   chmod +x noteflow-installer_linux_amd64
   ./noteflow-installer_linux_amd64
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to choose installation directory
4. Optionally add to PATH for global access
5. Run `noteflow-go` from any directory!

**Perfect for users without admin access** - installs to user directory only.

### Direct Download
1. Download the prebuilt binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Xafloc/NoteFlow-Go/releases). Filenames follow the pattern `noteflow-go_<os>_<arch>` (`.exe` on Windows) — e.g. `noteflow-go_darwin_arm64` for Apple Silicon Macs. Each asset is the binary itself, no archive to extract.
2. Mark it executable and place it on your PATH:
   ```bash
   chmod +x noteflow-go_darwin_arm64
   mv noteflow-go_darwin_arm64 /usr/local/bin/noteflow-go
   ```
3. Run `noteflow-go` from any directory.

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xafloc/NoteFlow-Go.git
cd NoteFlow-Go
go build -o noteflow-go .
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Navigate to any project folder**
   ```bash
   cd ~/my-project
   ```

2. **Start NoteFlow-Go**
   ```bash
   noteflow-go
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   - Server starts automatically (usually `http://localhost:8000`)
   - Creates `notes.md` in current directory
   - Registers folder for global task management

4. **Create notes and tasks**
   - Write markdown with `- [ ]` for tasks
   - Use `+http://example.com` to archive websites
   - Drag & drop files for uploads

## 🌐 Global Task Management

NoteFlow-Go introduces **cross-folder task synchronization**:

- **Local View**: See tasks for current project folder
- **Global View**: Access `/global-tasks` to see all tasks across all registered folders
- **Two-Way Sync**: Complete tasks from either view
- **Automatic Registration**: Each NoteFlow instance auto-registers its folder
- **Background Sync**: Tasks stay synchronized across all projects
- **Path Navigation**: Hover over folder names to see full paths, click to copy to clipboard

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Markdown & MathJax
```markdown
# My Research Notes

Calculate eigenvalues for matrix:
$$\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{(a+d) \pm \sqrt{(a+d)^2 - 4(ad-bc)}}{2}$$

## Tasks
- [ ] Complete problem set
- [x] Review lecture notes
```

### Website Archiving
```markdown
+https://example.com/article
```
Creates self-contained HTML with **comprehensive resource inlining**:
- CSS stylesheets and @import rules
- JavaScript files and dependencies  
- Images, fonts, and binary assets (base64 encoded)
- Fully offline-capable archived pages

### File Uploads
Drag any file into the interface - automatically creates `assets/` folder and links.

## 🛠️ Configuration

NoteFlow stores user preferences in `~/.config/noteflow/noteflow.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": "light-blue",
  "port": 8000
}
```
